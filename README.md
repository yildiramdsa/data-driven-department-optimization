In the Human Resources Department, **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Deep Learning models** are used to predict employee turnover, providing actionable insights for retention strategies. The Marketing Department leverages **K-Means**, **PCA**, and **Autoencoders** for customer segmentation, enabling more targeted campaigns. In Sales, **time series forecasting** with **Facebook Prophet** helps predict daily sales, ensuring efficient inventory management. The Operations Department employs **deep learning models** for chest disease detection, enhancing medical diagnostics. Finally, the Public Relations Department applies **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** to predict customer satisfaction and improve engagement strategies.
